Summary: Everything worked. All functions outputted the required values and sorted numbers in order. All files complied as required, however for the second requirement when I input a string it is ouputted as a zero after sorting. Other that this uncertainty everything worked.

Question: 

1. Suppose you were given an object module (with no access to source code) that sorted an array of integers very efficiently. However, the sort function in the object module must be invoked with the following signature: 

betterSort(int data[], first, last);

where the array to sort is data and the parameters first and the last give the indices of the portion of the array that is to be sorted.

How could you write a mySort() function with the signature used in this lab that could exploit the better sorting function in the supplied object module.

Anwswer: 

In order to write a mySort() function with the signature used in this lab, you use the fact that the variable 'nDataItems' in the main function is used to define the size of the array. Therefore, by taking the 'first variable as the first value in the array, the value can be assigned as data[0] and the last vcan be data[nDataItems]. All done by trating 'first' and 'last' like temporary variables before the array is sorted using the insertion sort. 

For example inside the mySort function betterSort would be used like this:
betterSort(d[], 0, n);
