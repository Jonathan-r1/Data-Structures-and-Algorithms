Summary: In this project my code works and runs well. I have successfully made the state machine that can correctly switch between states based on the terminal input. I have sucessfully implemented the change command, however, I have had issues with the delete and garbage commands which do not collect garbage or delete, but instead output print statements saying no garbage or deletions were completed. Overall, I was able to make a state machine sucessfully in this lab.
